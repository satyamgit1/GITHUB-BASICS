# GITHUB-BASICS
 # Commands you can use to push code to an existing GitHub repository using Visual Studio Code:
# Navigate to your local project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Initialize a Git repository if not already initialized
git init

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Check the status to review the changes you are about to commit
git status

# Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message
git commit -m "Your detailed commit message here"

# Add the remote repository URL (replace 'yourrepo_url' with the actual repository URL)
git remote add origin yourrepo_url

# Push the changes to the main branch (replace 'main' with the appropriate branch name)
git push -u origin main


Explanation of each command:

cd path/to/your/project: Change directory to your project folder.

git init: Initialize a new Git repository if it hasn't been initialized before.

git add .: Stage all changes in your project for the upcoming commit.

git status: View the status of your changes, ensuring you are committing what you intend.

git commit -m "Your detailed commit message here": Commit the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.

git remote add origin yourrepo_url: Link your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

git push -u origin main: Push your committed changes to the main branch of the remote repository on GitHub. The -u flag sets up tracking, so in the future, you can use git push without specifying the branch.

Make sure to replace yourrepo_url with the actual URL of your GitHub repository, and adjust the branch name if you are working on a branch other than 'main'.
